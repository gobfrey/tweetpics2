Unpack / clone / place project files in a directory, and create a 'www' directory.  This should be visible to your webserver.  Configure your webserver to serve this directory.

Create a secrets.ini file in the project directory, copying the structure of the secrets.ini.example file.

Run the download_new_tweets.pl script in the bin directory to download new tweets from Twitter.

Run the update_website.pl script in the bin directory to generate the website.

The website should now be being served.  Add the download_new_tweets.pl and update_website.pl scripts to the crontab to run periodically.
